To make text into a clickable link in HTML, you can use the anchor tag (`<a>`). Here's how:

1. First, decide the text that you want to turn into a link. For example, let's say you want to make the text "Click here" into a link.

2. Wrap the text within the opening and closing anchor tags. The opening tag starts with `<a>` and the closing tag ends with `</a>`. Like this:
   ```
   <a>Click here</a>
   ```
